# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics Education

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This textbook provides a structured learning path from fundamental ROS 2 concepts to advanced Vision-Language-Action robotics systems.

### Overview of Learning Modules

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System** - Master the Robot Operating System fundamentals that serve as the backbone for robotic applications
- **Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation** - Explore simulation environments and digital replicas for testing robotic systems
- **Module 3: AI Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Implement artificial intelligence and machine learning for robotic decision-making
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Robotics** - Combine perception, understanding, and action for advanced robotic capabilities

### Learning Path

Follow our recommended 13-week roadmap to progress systematically through the material, starting with ROS 2 fundamentals and advancing to complex VLA robotics implementations.
