# Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System

## Introduction

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the foundational nervous system for robotic applications. This module introduces the core concepts, architecture, and tools that enable communication, coordination, and control in robotic systems.

ROS 2 provides the essential infrastructure for robotics development, including message passing, package management, and hardware abstraction. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for building complex robotic applications.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the ROS 2 architecture and its key components
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages, nodes, and workspaces
- Implement communication patterns using topics, services, and actions
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging, visualization, and system monitoring
- Apply best practices for ROS 2 development and deployment

## Tools Required

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (or latest LTS version)
- Development environment (Linux recommended)
- Python 3.8+ or C++17 compiler
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of Linux command line

## Summary

Module 1 establishes the foundation for all subsequent robotics development by covering the ROS 2 ecosystem. The concepts learned here form the backbone of robotic applications and are essential for understanding more advanced topics in later modules.

This module provides the necessary tools and knowledge to begin developing robotic applications with proper architecture and communication patterns. The skills acquired will be directly applicable to the simulation, AI, and perception modules that follow.
