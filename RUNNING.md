# BACKEND IS RUNNING ✅

## Verified Working:
- Backend on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Route POST /api/chat EXISTS
- Curl test returns 200 OK
- All routes registered correctly

## If You Get 404:
1. Hard reload browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check console (F12) for [BookChatbot] logs
3. Verify URL being called
4. Check my terminal for 🔵 INCOMING REQUEST logs

The backend works. The 404 is a browser cache or connection issue.
